## Correction
There is a slip-up in the equation numbering in the published paper (https://doi.org/10.3389/fams.2022.822782) from equation 49 and onwards. The pre-print version in `tex/manuscript.pdf` has additionally been published to Zenodo and contains the correct equations, see https://zenodo.org/record/7088955.
