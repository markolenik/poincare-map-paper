                  in a network of two oscillatory neurons coupled with
                  re- ciprocal inhibition. We combine the phase
                  response curves of the neurons with the short-term
                  synaptic plasticity properties of the synapses to
                  define Poincaré maps for the activity of an
                  oscillatory network. Fixed points of these maps
                  correspond to the phase-locked modes of the
                  network. These maps allow us to analyze the
                  dependence of the resulting network activity on the
                  properties of network components. Using a
                  combination of analysis and simulations, we show how
                  various parameters of the model affect the existence
                  and stability of phase-locked solutions. We find
                  conditions on the synaptic plasticity profiles and
                  the phase response curves of the neurons for the
                  network to be able to maintain a constant firing
                  period, while varying the phase of locking between
                  the neurons or vice versa. A generalization to
                  cobwebbing for two-dimensional maps is also

                  enough. The results apply to any Type I oscillator

                  movements in six different preparations for which
                  the neuronal circuits are available. The overall
                  function of reciprocal inhibition, when combined
                  with a variety of dynamic properties in each of the
                  circuits, is to generate stable antiphasic or
                  multiphasic output patterns. Apparent redundancy in
                  the identified circuits may lend additional
                  robustness to the oscillations, but it also
                  increases the difficulty of identifying critical

                  first edition of this book proved that the basic principles
                  used to select and present the material made sense. The idea
                  was to write a simple text that could serve as a seri ous
                  introduction to the subject. Of course, the meaning of
                  "simplicity" varies from person to person and from country to
                  country. The word "introduction" contains even more ambiguity.
                  To start reading this book, only a moder ate knowledge of
                  linear algebra and calculus is required. Other preliminaries,
                  qualified as "elementary" in modern mathematics, are
                  explicitly formulated in the book. These include the Fredholm
                  Alternative for linear systems and the multidimensional
                  Implicit Function Theorem. Using these very limited tools, a
                  framewo:k of notions, results, and methods is gradually built
                  that allows one to read (and possibly write) scientific papers
                  on bifurcations of nonlinear dynamical systems. Among other
                  things, progress in the sciences means that mathematical
                  results and methods that once were new become standard and
                  routinely used by the research and development community.
                  Hopefully, this edition of the book will contribute to this
                  process. The book's structure has been kept intact. Most of
                  the changes introduced reflect recent theoretical and software
                  developments in which the author was involved. Important
                  changes in the third edition can be summarized as follows. A
                  new section devoted to the fold-flip bifurcation for maps has
                  appeared in Chapter 9.},

                  displayed by central pattern generators and other neural
                  circuits. Understanding this complex activity requires the
                  knowledge of the interplay between the intrinsic cell
                  properties and the properties of synaptic coupling between the
                  cells. Here we describe a simple method that allows us to
                  investigate the existence and stability of anti-phase bursting
                  solutions in a network of two spiking neurons, each possessing
                  a T-type calcium current and coupled by reciprocal inhibition.
                  We derive a one-dimensional map which fully characterizes the
                  genesis and regulation of anti-phase bursting arising from the
                  interaction of the T-current properties with the properties of
                  synaptic inhibition. This map is the burst length return map
                  formed as the composition of two distinct one-dimensional maps
                  that are each regulated by a different set of model
                  parameters. Although each map is constructed using the
                  properties of a single isolated model neuron, the composition
                  of the two maps accurately captures the behavior of the full
                  network. We analyze the parameter sensitivity of these maps to
                  determine the influence of both the intrinsic cell properties
                  and the synaptic properties on the burst length, and to find
                  the conditions under which multistability of several bursting
                  solutions is achieved. Although the derivation of the map
                  relies on a number of simplifying assumptions, we discuss how
                  the principle features of this dimensional reduction method
                  could be extended to more realistic model networks.},

                  stimulation produce a variety of types of oscillatory behavior
                  when the internal medium contains the Ca++ chelator EGTA.
                  Oscillations are abolished if Ca++ is removed from the
                  external medium, or if the K+ conductance is blocked.
                  Available voltage-clamp data indicate that the cell's active
                  conductance systems are exceptionally simple. Given the
                  complexity of barnacle fiber voltage behavior, this seems
                  paradoxical. This paper presents an analysis of the possible
                  modes of behavior available to a system of two noninactivating
                  conductance mechanisms, and indicates a good correspondence to
                  the types of behavior exhibited by barnacle fiber. The
                  differential equations of a simple equivalent circuit for the
                  fiber are dealt with by means of some of the mathematical
                  techniques of nonlinear mechanics. General features of the
                  system are (a) a propensity to produce damped or sustained
                  oscillations over a rather broad parameter range, and (b)
                  considerable latitude in the shape of the oscillatory
                  potentials. It is concluded that for cells subject to
                  changeable parameters (either from cell to cell or with time
                  during cellular activity), a system dominated by two
                  noninactivating conductances can exhibit varied oscillatory
                  and bistable behavior.},

  abstract        = {Synaptic depression is a form of short-term plasticity
                  exhibited by many synapses. Nonetheless, the functional
                  significance of synaptic depression in oscillatory networks is
                  not well understood. We show that, in a recurrent inhibitory
                  network that includes an intrinsic oscillator, synaptic
                  depression can give rise to two distinct modes of network
                  operation. When the maximal conductance of the depressing
                  synapse is small, the oscillation period is determined by the
                  oscillator component. Increasing the maximal conductance
                  beyond a threshold value activates a positive-feedback
                  mechanism that greatly enhances the synaptic strength. In this
                  mode, the oscillation period is determined by the strength and
                  dynamics of the depressing synapse. Because of the
                  regenerative nature of the feedback mechanism, the circuit can
                  be switched from one mode of operation to another by a very
                  small change in the maximal conductance of the depressing
                  synapse. Our model was inspired by experimental work on the
                  pyloric network of the lobster. The pyloric network produces a
                  simple motor rhythm generated by a pacemaker neuron that
                  receives feedback inhibition from a depressing synapse. In
                  some preparations, elimination of the synapse had no effect on
                  the period of the rhythm, whereas in other preparations, there
                  was a significant decrease in the period. We propose that the
                  pyloric network can operate in either of the two modes
                  suggested by the model, depending on the maximal conductance
                  of the depressing synapse.},

                  with PIR, and can be triggered in systems of
                  nonpacemakers without requiring tonic
                  excitation. The repetition rates of these patterns
                  are determined largely by the PIR parameters. The
                  patterns resist perturbation by phasic synaptic
                  inputs, but can be modulated or turned off by tonic
                  inputs. One pair of PIR neurons can be entrained by
                  another pair with a different repetition rate to
                  produce more complex firing patterns.}

  abstract        = {Xenopus embryos show two distinct rhythmic motor patterns:
                  swimming and struggling. Both can be generated by spinal cord
                  circuitry and evoked by stimulation of a single skin sensory
                  pathway (Soffe, 1991b). This presents a valuable opportunity
                  to explore mechanisms for vertebrate motor pattern switching.
                  Swimming and struggling have been compared using intracellular
                  recording from spinal neurons in immobilized embryos.
                  Underlying synaptic drive was similar; motoneurons and
                  premotor interneurons were excited in phase with ipsilateral
                  motor root discharge and inhibited in phase with contralateral
                  motor root discharge. Excitation was stronger during
                  struggling and associated with short bursts of impulses,
                  contrasting with single spikes per cycle during swimming.
                  Excitation was reduced in both patterns by local application
                  of 1 mM kynurenic acid, indicating excitatory amino acid
                  mediation. Inhibition was antagonized by 1 microM strychnine,
                  indicating glycine mediation. Many motoneurons (76\%) and
                  premotor interneurons (68\%) fired during both swimming and
                  struggling, including examples of all three spinal premotor
                  interneuron classes. Most of the remaining motoneurons (20\%)
                  and premotor interneurons (24\%) fired only during struggling,
                  providing roughly 30\% more active neurons than during
                  swimming. To investigate whether new neuronal classes become
                  active during struggling, recordings were made from sensory
                  neurons and sensory interneurons. Rohon-Beard sensory neurons
                  did not fire during either swimming or struggling.
                  Dorsolateral commissural sensory interneurons received
                  rhythmic, strychnine-sensitive inhibition during both swimming
                  and struggling and also did not fire. Neither of these
                  neuronal classes is therefore recruited to the circuitry for
                  struggling. Although behaviorally distinct, Xenopus embryo
                  swimming and struggling motor patterns appear to employ
                  similar synaptic drive. I propose that this reflects the
                  common nature of much of the premotor circuitry that drives
                  them. Extra neurons are recruited to this circuitry during
                  struggling, but only from within classes that also participate
                  in swimming.},
