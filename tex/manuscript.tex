  \section{}
  Short-term synaptic plasticity is found in many areas of the central nervous system.
  In the inhibitory half-centre central pattern generators involved in locomotion, synaptic depression is believed to act as a burst termination mechanism, allowing networks to generate anti-phase bursting patterns of varying periods.
  To better understand burst generation in these central patter generators, we study a minimal network of two neurons coupled through depressing synapses.
  Depending on the strength of the synaptic conductance between the two neurons, this network can produce symmetric $n-n$ anti-phase bursts, where neurons fire $n$ spikes in alternation, with the period of such solutions increasing with the strength of the synaptic conductance.
  Relying on the timescale disparity in the model, we reduce the eight-dimensional network equations to a fully-explicit scalar Poincaré burst map.
  This map tracks the state of synaptic depression from one burst to the next and captures the complex bursting dynamics of the network.
  Fixed points of this map are associated with stable burst solutions of the full network model, and are created through fold bifurcations of maps.
  We derive conditions that describe period-increment bifurcations between stable $n-n$ and $(n+1)-(n+1)$ bursts, producing a full bifurcation diagram of the burst cycle period.
  Predictions of the Poincaré map fit excellently with numerical simulations of the full network model and allow the study of parameter sensitivity for rhythm generation.
